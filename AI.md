* __Artifician Intelligence__ - way to make machines think and
behave intelligently.

* Importance
  * AI has the ability to impact every aspect of our lives. 
  * The field of AI tries to understand patterns and behaviors of entities.

## Types of AI
### Type 1

   * The idea behind the general AI is to make a system that could be smarter and think like a human by its own.
   * DNE
3. __Strong | Super AI__

     * Can reason
     * make judgments
     * plan
     * learn
     * communicate
   * Hypothetical
### Type 2
* Based on Functionality
* __Reactive machines__ - Are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.
* __Limited memory__ - Can store past memories or data for a short span of time.
  * Examples: Self-driving cars
* __Theory of mind__ - Understands human emotion, people, beliefs, and can socially interfact like us.
  * Examples: Sophia, Kismet

3. The decisions should result in action.
4. The action taken by the AI agent must be [rational](./Intelligent%20Agents.md#rational-agent).

## Training
